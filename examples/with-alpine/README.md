# With Alpine.js example

This example is very similar to the [simple one](../simple), but it has the ability to toggle between themes, apart from showing a page with a nested section with dark theme. It shows you can use not only entire themed pages, but also themed sections, inside other themed sections!

ðŸ§ª This is the version used for [this project's landing page]()

### Test it

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/estevanmaito/tailwindcss-multi-theme.git
```

Enter the project folder and execute it:

```sh
cd tailwindcss-multi-theme/examples/with-alpine
npm install
npm run tailwind
```

Now you can just open `index.html` in the browser.
